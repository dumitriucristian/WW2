## Maps       
Given we have a map  of 100 x 100 squares       
And units that can move different nr of squares      
And each unit have different attack power       
And can travel different nr of squares      
When two oposite units met several casualties are done      
Then the user who loose all his troops loose the game.      

##Move              
Given there are different types of landscape    
when units move through plain field 
Then has 100% moving capacity   

Given there are different types of landscape    
When units move through woods
Then has 50% moving capacity    

Given there are different types of landscape    
When units move through mountaignes 
Then has 20% moving capacity    

##Attack
